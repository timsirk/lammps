<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Create bonds between pairs of atoms as a simulation runs according to
specified criteria.  This can be used to model cross-linking of
polymers, the formation of a percolation network, etc.  In this
context, a bond means an interaction between a pair of atoms computed
by the <A HREF = "bond_style.html">bond_style</A> command.  Once the bond is created
it will be permanently in place.  Optionally, the creation of a bond
can also create angle, dihedral, and improper interactions that bond
is part of. See the discussion of the <I>mol</I> keyword below. 
</P>
<P>This is different than a <A HREF = "pair_style.html">pairwise</A> bond-order
potential such as Tersoff or AIREBO which infers bonds and many-body
interactions based on the current geometry of a small cluster of atoms
and effectively creates and destroys bonds and higher-order many-body
interactions from timestep to timestep as atoms move.
</P>
<P>A check for possible new bonds is performed every <I>Nevery</I> timesteps.
If two atoms I,J are within a distance <I>Rmin</I> of each other, if I is
of atom type <I>itype</I>, if J is of atom type <I>jtype</I>, if both I and J
are in the specified fix group, if a bond does not already exist
between I and J, and if both I and J meet their respective <I>maxbond</I>
requirement (explained below), then I,J is labeled as a "possible"
bond pair.
</P>
<P>If several atoms are close to an atom, it may have multiple possible
bond partners.  Every atom checks its list of possible bond partners
and labels the closest such partner as its "sole" bond partner.  After
this is done, if atom I has atom J as its sole partner, and atom J has
atom I as its sole partner, then the I,J bond is "eligible" to be
formed.
</P>
<P>Note that these rules mean an atom will only be part of at most one
created bond on a given timestep.  It also means that if atom I
chooses atom J as its sole partner, but atom J chooses atom K is its
sole partner (due to Rjk < Rij), then this means atom I will not form
a bond on this timestep, even if it has other possible bond partners.
</P>
<P>It is permissible to have <I>itype</I> = <I>jtype</I>.  <I>Rmin</I> must be <= the
pairwise cutoff distance between <I>itype</I> and <I>jtype</I> atoms, as defined
by the <A HREF = "pair_style.html">pair_style</A> command.
</P>
<P>The <I>imax</I> and <I>jmax</I> keywords can be used to limit the bonding
functionality of the participating atoms.  Each atom keeps track of
how many bonds of <I>bondtype</I> it already has.  If atom I of
itype already has <I>maxbond</I> bonds (as set by the <I>imax</I>
keyword), then it will not form any more.  Likewise for atom J.  If
<I>maxbond</I> is set to 0, then there is no limit on the number of bonds
that can be formed with that atom.
</P>
<P>The <I>mol</I> keyword can be used to control the 
the atom types and charges of atom I and J, and other atoms near a new bond.
This means that atoms near a new bond can have different pairwise parameters
before and after the new bond by specifying different
<A HREF = "pair_coeff.html">pair_coeff</A> coefficients.  If you do not wish the
atom types or charges of these <I>influenced atoms</I> to change, the same 
before/after values should be given in the <I>RTypes</I> and <I>RCharges</I> fields 
of the <I>reaction template</I>. Further, the bondtype of the new bond is assigned 
from the corresponding entry of <I>itype</I> and <I>jtype</I> in the <I>RBonds</I> field of 
the reaction template. Likewise, the types of new angles, dihedrals, and 
impropers are assigned from the <I>Rangles</I>, <I>RDihedrals</I> and <I>RImpropers</I> 
fields. The doc for <A HREF = "molecule.html">molecule</A> command descibes the fields of 
the reaction template and influenced atoms. The <I>mol</I> keyword is required. 
</P>
<P>The <I>prob</I> keyword can also effect whether an eligible bond is
actually created.  The <I>fraction</I> setting must be a value between 0.0
and 1.0.  A uniform random number between 0.0 and 1.0 is generated and
the eligible bond is only created if the random number < fraction.
</P>
<P>When a bond is created, data structures within LAMMPS that store bond
topology are updated to reflect the creation.  If the bond is part of
new 3-body (angle) or 4-body (dihedral, improper) interactions, you
can choose to create new angles, dihedrals, impropers as well, using
the <I>mol</I> keyword.  All of these changes
typically affect pairwise interactions between atoms that are now part
of new bonds, angles, etc.
</P>
<P>NOTE: One data structure that is not updated when a bond is created are
the molecule IDs stored by each atom.  Even though two molecules
become one moleclue due to the created bond, all atoms in the new
moleclue retain their original molecule IDs.
</P>
<P>NOTE: To create a new bond, the internal LAMMPS data structures that
store this information must have space for it.  When LAMMPS is
initialized from a data file, the list of bonds is scanned and the
maximum number of bonds per atom is tallied.  If some atom will
acquire more bonds than this limit as this fix operates, then the
"extra bond per atom" parameter must be set to allow for it.  Ditto
for "extra angle per atom", "extra dihedral per atom", and "extra
improper per atom" if angles, dihedrals, or impropers are being added
when bonds are created.  See the <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> or
<A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> command for more details.  Note that a
data file with no atoms can be used if you wish to add unbonded atoms
via the <A HREF = "create_atoms.html">create atoms</A> command, e.g. for a
percolation simulation.
</P>
<P>NOTE: LAMMPS stores and maintains a data structure with a list of the
1st, 2nd, and 3rd neighbors of each atom (within the bond topology of
the system) for use in weighting pairwise interactions for bonded
atoms.  Note that adding a single bond always adds a new 1st neighbor
but may also induce *many* new 2nd and 3rd neighbors, depending on the
molecular topology of your system.  The "extra special per atom"
parameter must typically be set to allow for the new maximum total
size (1st + 2nd + 3rd neighbors) of this per-atom list.  There are 3
ways to do this.  See the <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> or
<A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> or "special_bonds extra" commands for
details.
</P>
<P>NOTE: The list of topological neighbors is updated for atoms
affected by the new bond.  This in turn affects which neighbors are
considered for pairwise interactions, using the weighting rules set by
the <A HREF = "special_bonds.html">special_bonds</A> command.  Consider a new bond
created between atoms I,J.  If J has a bonded neighbor K, then K
becomes a 2nd neighbor of I.  Even if the <I>mol</I> keyword is not used
to create angle I-J-K, the pairwise interaction between I and K will
be potentially turned off or weighted by the 1-3 weighting specified
by the <A HREF = "special_bonds.html">special_bonds</A> command.  This is the case
even if the "angle yes" option was used with that command.  The same
is true for 3rd neighbors (1-4 interactions), and
the "dihedral yes" option used with the
<A HREF = "special_bonds.html">special_bonds</A> command.
</P>
<P>Note that even if your simulation starts with no bonds, you must
define a <A HREF = "bond_style.html">bond_style</A> and use the
<A HREF = "bond_coeff.html">bond_coeff</A> command to specify coefficients for the
<I>bondtype</I>.  Similarly, if new atom types are specified by the
<I>imax</I> or <I>jmax</I> keywords, they must be within the range of atom
types allowed by the simulation and pairwise coefficients must be
specified for the new types.
</P>
<P>Computationally, each timestep this fix operates, it loops over
neighbor lists and computes distances between pairs of atoms in the
list.  It also communicates between neighboring processors to
coordinate which bonds are created.  Moreover, if any bonds are
created, neighbor lists must be immediately updated on the same
timestep.  This is to insure that any pairwise interactions that
should be turned "off" due to a bond creation, because they are now
excluded by the presence of the bond and the settings of the
<A HREF = "special_bonds.html">special_bonds</A> command, will be immediately
recognized.  All of these operations increase the cost of a timestep.
Thus you should be cautious about invoking this fix too frequently.
</P>
<P>You can dump out snapshots of the current bond topology via the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump
local</A> command.
</P>
<P>NOTE: Creating a bond typically alters the energy of a system.  You
should be careful not to choose bond creation criteria that induce a
dramatic change in energy.  For example, if you define a very stiff
harmonic bond and create it when 2 atoms are separated by a distance
far from the equilibribum bond length, then the 2 atoms will oscillate
dramatically when the bond is formed.  More generally, you may need to
thermostat your system to compensate for energy changes resulting from
created bonds (and angles, dihedrals, impropers).
