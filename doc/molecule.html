<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a molecule template that can be used as part of other LAMMPS
commands, typically to define a collection of particles as a bonded
molecule or a rigid body.  Commands that currently use molecule
templates include:
</P>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "fix_deposit.html">fix deposit</A>
<LI><A HREF = "fix_pour.html">fix pour</A>
<LI><A HREF = "fix_rigid.html">fix rigid/small</A>
<LI><A HREF = "fix_shake.html">fix shake</A>
<LI><A HREF = "fix_gcmc.html">fix gcmc</A>
<LI><A HREF = "create_atoms.html">create_atoms</A> 
<LI><A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style template</A> 
</UL>
<P>The ID of a molecule template can only contain alphanumeric characters
and underscores.
</P>
<P>A single template can contain multiple molecules, listed one per file.
Some of the commands listed above currently use only the first
molecule in the template, and will issue a warning if the template
contains multiple molecules.  The <A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style
template</A> command allows multiple-molecule templates
to define a system with more than one templated molecule.
</P>
<P>Each filename can be followed by optional keywords which are applied
only to the molecule in the file as used in this template.  This is to
make it easy to use the same molecule file in different molecule
templates or in different simulations.  You can specify the same file
multiple times with different optional keywords.
</P>
<P>The <I>offset</I>, <I>toff</I>, <I>aoff</I>, <I>doff</I>, <I>ioff</I> keywords add the
specified offset values to the atom types, bond types, angle types,
dihedral types, and/or improper types as they are read from the
molecule file.  E.g. if <I>toff</I> = 2, and the file uses atom types
1,2,3, then each created molecule will have atom types 3,4,5.  For the
<I>offset</I> keyword, all five offset values must be specified, but
individual values will be ignored if the molecule template does not
use that attribute (e.g. no bonds).
</P>
<P>The <I>scale</I> keyword scales the size of the molecule.  This can be
useful for modeling polydisperse granular rigid bodies.  The scale
factor is applied to each of these properties in the molecule file, if
they are defined: the individual particle coordinates (Coords
section), the individual mass of each particle (Masses section), the
individual diameters of each particle (Diameters section), the total
mass of the molecule (header keyword = mass), the center-of-mass of
the molecule (header keyword = com), and the moments of inertia of the
molecule (header keyword = inertia).
</P>
<P>NOTE: The molecule command can be used to define molecules with bonds,
angles, dihedrals, imporopers, or special bond lists of neighbors
within a molecular topology, so that you can later add the molecules
to your simulation, via one or more of the commands listed above.  If
such molecules do not already exist when LAMMPS creates the simulation
box, via the <A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> or
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> command, when you later add them you may
overflow the pre-allocated data structures which store molecular
topology information with each atom, and an error will be generated.
Both the <A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> command and the data files read
by the <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> command have "extra" options which
insure space is allocated for storing topology info for molecules that
are added later.
</P>
<P>The format of an individual molecule file is similar to the data file
read by the <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> commands, and is as follows.
</P>
<P>A molecule file has a header and a body.  The header appears first.
The first line of the header is always skipped; it typically contains
a description of the file.  Then lines are read one at a time.  Lines
can have a trailing comment starting with '#' that is ignored.  If the
line is blank (only whitespace after comment is deleted), it is
skipped.  If the line contains a header keyword, the corresponding
value(s) is read from the line.  If it doesn't contain a header
keyword, the line begins the body of the file.
</P>
<P>The body of the file contains zero or more sections.  The first line
of a section has only a keyword.  The next line is skipped.  The
remaining lines of the section contain values.  The number of lines
depends on the section keyword as described below.  Zero or more blank
lines can be used between sections.  Sections can appear in any order,
with a few exceptions as noted below.
</P>
<P>These are the recognized header keywords.  Header lines can come in
any order.  The numeric value(s) are read from the beginning of the
line.  The keyword should appear at the end of the line.  All these
settings have default values, as explained below.  A line need only
appear if the value(s) are different than the default.
</P>
<UL><LI>N <I>atoms</I> = # of atoms N in molecule, default = 0
<LI>Nb <I>bonds</I> = # of bonds Nb in molecule, default = 0
<LI>Na <I>angles</I> = # of angles Na in molecule, default = 0
<LI>Nd <I>dihedrals</I> = # of dihedrals Nd in molecule, default = 0
<LI>Ni <I>impropers</I> = # of impropers Ni in molecule, default = 0
<LI>Mtotal <I>mass</I> = total mass of molecule
<LI>Xc Yc Zc <I>com</I> = coordinates of center-of-mass of molecule
<LI>Ixx Iyy Izz Ixy Ixz Iyz <I>inertia</I> = 6 components of inertia tensor of molecule 
</UL>
<P>For <I>mass</I>, <I>com</I>, and <I>inertia</I>, the default is for LAMMPS to
calculate this quantity itself if needed, assuming the molecules
consists of a set of point particles or finite-size particles (with a
non-zero diameter) that do not overlap.  If finite-size particles in
the molecule do overlap, LAMMPS will not account for the overlap
effects when calculating any of these 3 quantities, so you should
pre-compute them yourself and list the values in the file.
</P>
<P>The mass and center-of-mass coordinates (Xc,Yc,Zc) are
self-explanatory.  The 6 moments of inertia (ixx,iyy,izz,ixy,ixz,iyz)
should be the values consistent with the current orientation of the
rigid body around its center of mass.  The values are with respect to
the simulation box XYZ axes, not with respect to the prinicpal axes of
the rigid body itself.  LAMMPS performs the latter calculation
internally.
</P>
<P>These are the allowed section keywords for the body of the file.
</P>
<UL><LI><I>Coords, Types, Charges, Diameters, Masses</I> = atom-property sections 
<LI><I>Bonds, Angles, Dihedrals, Impropers</I> = molecular topology sections 
<LI><I>Special Bond Counts, Special Bonds</I> = special neighbor info
<LI><I>Shake Flags, Shake Atoms, Shake Bond Types</I> = SHAKE info 
</UL>
<P>If a Bonds section is specified then the Special Bond Counts and
Special Bonds sections can also be used, if desired, to explicitly
list the 1-2, 1-3, 1-4 neighbors within the molecule topology (see
details below).  This is optional since if these sections are not
included, LAMMPS will auto-generate this information.  Note that
LAMMPS uses this info to properly exclude or weight bonded pairwise
interactions between bonded atoms.  See the
<A HREF = "special_bonds.html">special_bonds</A> command for more details.  One
reason to list the special bond info explicitly is for the
<A HREF = "tutorial_drude.html">thermalized Drude oscillator model</A> which treats
the bonds between nuclear cores and Drude electrons in a different
manner.
</P>
<P>NOTE: Whether a section is required depends on how the molecule
template is used by other LAMMPS commands.  For example, to add a
molecule via the <A HREF = "fix_deposit.html">fix deposit</A> command, the Coords
and Types sections are required.  To add a rigid body via the <A HREF = "fix_pout.html">fix
pour</A> command, the Bonds (Angles, etc) sections are not
required, since the molecule will be treated as a rigid body.  Some
sections are optional.  For example, the <A HREF = "fix_pour.html">fix pour</A>
command can be used to add "molecules" which are clusters of
finite-size granular particles.  If the Diameters section is not
specified, each particle in the molecule will have a default diameter
of 1.0.  See the doc pages for LAMMPS commands that use molecule
templates for more details.
</P>
<P>Each section is listed below in alphabetic order.  The format of each
section is described including the number of lines it must contain and
rules (if any) for whether it can appear in the data file.  In each
case the ID is ignored; it is simply included for readability, and
should be a number from 1 to Nlines for the section, indicating which
atom (or bond, etc) the entry applies to.  The lines are assumed to be
listed in order from 1 to Nlines, but LAMMPS does not check for this.

<HR>

<P>The molecule command can also define a reaction template. A reaction template describes the way in which the local environment near a newly created or broken bond is updated by a fix or command. Currently only <A HREF = "fix_bond_create.html">fix_bond_create</A> and <A HREF = "fix_bond_break.html">fix_bond_break</A> support reaction templates. 
</P>
<P>When a new bond is created, the bond type and any changes to the environment near the bond are determined by scanning the atom types of a set of nearby atoms called <I>influenced atoms</I>. The influenced atoms include only the two atoms in the new bond (<I>i</I>, <I>j</I>) and the 1-2 and 1-3 bond neighbors of <I>i</I> and <I>j</I>. New 3-body interactions (angle) and 4-body (dihedral, improper) interactions are inferred from the influenced atoms. A new bond is added only if its sequence of atom types is found on reaction template in the <I>RBonds</I> section. Likewise, an inferred angle, dihedral or improper will be added only if it is matched in the <I>RAngles</I>, <I>RDihedrals</I> or <I>RImpropers</I> sections. Further, the atom types and charges of influenced atoms are updated to the new values given in the <I>RTypes</I> and <I>RCharges</I> sections of the reaction template. 
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The data structures within LAMMPS that store bond topology are updated to reflect the creation of the new bonds, angles, etc. The internal LAMMPS data structures that store this information must have space for it. The "extra bond per atom" parameter must be set in the data file to allow space for any new bonds that are created. Ditto for "extra angle per atom", "extra dihedral per atom", and "extra improper per atom" if angles, dihedrals, or impropers are being added as new bonds are created. See the <A HREF = "fix_bond_create.html">fix_bond_create</A>, <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> or <A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> command for more details.
