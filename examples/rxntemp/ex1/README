This is an example shows some features of fix/bond/create/rxn with a reaction template. The system models a curing reaction between coarse-grain polymer chains and crosslinker beads.  

polymer chain length 10
chain ends are type 1
chain interior beads are type 2

crosslinker chain length 1
crosslinker bead type 3

chain ends form 1 new bond each
crosslinkers form 3 new bonds each

The chain model is LJ + FENE without charges. The chain ends make new bonds with the crosslinkers. When a new bond is made, one or more new angles and dihederals are added according to the atom-type sequences in template.kg

case 1: one chain attaches to a crosslinker
...2-2-1 + 3 = ...2-2-1-3
bond 1-3 is added, type 2
angle 2-1-3 is added, type 1

case 2: two chains bridged by a crosslinker
...2-2-1 + 3-1-2-2... = ...2-2-1-3-1-2-2...
bond 1-3 is added, type 2
angle 1-3-1 is added, type 2
angle 2-3-1 is added, type 1
dihedral 2-1-3-1 is added, type 1
