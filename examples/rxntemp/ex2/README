This is an example shows some features of fix/bond/create/rxn with a reaction template. 

polymer chain length 4
chain ends are atom types 1 and 4. these have opposite charges +/- and attract
chain interior beads are type 2 and 3, no charge

LJ + FENE with charges

Step 1. Dynamics with fix/bond/create/rxn is used to connect the chain ends. The two chains form a ring. When a new bond is made, the charges of the two beads are zeroed, and angles and dihedrals are added per the reaction template. 

Step 2. The FENE bonds of the chain are broken in tension with fix/bond/break/rxn. The charges are returned to the initial value and the all angles and dihedrals are removed.

Different reaction templates are used for fix/bond/create/rxn and fix/bond/break/rxn
